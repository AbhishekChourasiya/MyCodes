### Tools
> Awesome tools that will make your life easier.


#### IDEs

| ☆ | Name | Platform | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ★★★ | [Vim](http://www.vim.org/download.php) | CLI / Cross-Platform | Vim is one of the most popular text editors among advanced programmers. It allows text-editing to be done very efficiently with solely keystrokes. Vim is also highly configurable, extensible and integrates with shells (command lines) really well. The only setback about Vim is that it has a high learning curve for beginners. |
| ★★★ | [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html) | CLI / Cross-Platform | Emacs is another popular text editor (or development environment to be more precise). The debate on "Vim vs. Emacs" is constantly brought up due to their popularity. Basically Emacs is more than just a text editor. It has plugins like file managers, web browsers, mail clients and news clients that allows users to performs these tasks directly inside Emacs. Emacs is "heavier" because of this, but it arguably has a relatively easier learning curve for beginners. |
| ★★★ | [Far Manager](http://www.farmanager.com/download.php?l=en) | Hybrid / Windows | Far Manager is the most widely-used editor in the RU/CIS competitive programming community. It's actually a file manager in its bare bones, but you can install [FarColorer](http://colorer.sourceforge.net/farplugin.html) - a syntax highlighter plugin to program on it. Properly configured, Far Manager allows you to navigate between files very efficiently while writing your codes. |
| ★★★ | [Code::Blocks](http://codeblocks.org/downloads) | GUI / Cross-Platform | Code::Blocks is the go-to IDE for C/C++. It's a full-fledged, versatile IDE with numerous great features. Code::Blocks is usually provided along with Vim in programming contests. |
| ★★★ | [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/#chooseYourEdition) | GUI / Cross-Platform | IntelliJ IDEA is certainly one of the best IDEs for Java. It's used by most competitive programmers who use Java as their main language. Be sure to check out [CHelper](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7091?pr=), a very handy plugin written for programming contests. |
| ★★☆ | [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) | GUI / Cross-Platform | Sublime Text is an extraordinary text editor. Packed with powerful and innovative features like Multiple Carets, Minimaps and Command Palletes, it attracts a strong and engaging community. Sublime Text is highly extensible, so be sure to have [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/) installed and explore perhaps one of the largest catalogue of plugins! |
| ★★☆ | [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/downloads/) | GUI / Cross-Platform | Eclipse is another good IDE for Java. It's an okay alternative to Intellij IDEA (A tad inferior to IDEA by today's standards). Sometimes contests only provide Eclipse for some reason, so this might be a good incentive to try and use Eclipse. |
| ★★☆ | [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/download/) | GUI / Cross-Platform | CLion, produced by JetBrains - the same company who made Intellij IDEA, is a powerful IDE for C++. Free educational licenses are available OR you can try out their [EAP (Early Access Program)](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/CLION/Early+Access+Program) which is still free as of June 20, 2016. You may want to turn off its code inspection feature as it will cause quite a bit of lag. |
| ★☆☆ | Other IDEs | Mixed | [☘Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx) is the IDE to use in case you want to code in C#, but beware that it will be a 7GB installation. ... Both [☘Atom](https://atom.io/) and [☘Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) are built with Electron (written in JavaScript) and therefore resource-hogging, unfit for speed coding. ... [☘CodeLite](http://codelite.org/) is a newly rising IDE. It's not good for speed coding because the load-up and project-creation times are extraordinary. | 

#### Personal use

[☘caide](https://github.com/slycelote/caide) (Visual Studio, CodeLite) ... [☘JHelper](http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/13369) (AppCode, CLion) | Great tools that parse contests, inline library codes and provide testing frameworks. They save you from spending your precious time on switching windows and copy-pasting back and forth. |
| ★★☆ | Codeforces Parsers: ... [☘Codeforces Parser](https://github.com/johnathan79717/codeforces-parser) ... [☘GoCF](https://github.com/sukeesh/GoCF) ... [☘cfparser](https://github.com/gnull/cfparser) (emacs) | These tools parse Codeforces contest problems and help run sample tests. |
| ★★★ | [The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS)](https://oeis.org/) | A stunning encyclopedia with a database of countless integer sequences. It also features a powerful search engine. Sometimes a seemingly difficult combinatorics problem could be equivalent to a simple or studied integer sequence. |
| ★★☆ | Syntax Highlighters: ... [☘tohtml.com](https://tohtml.com/) ... [☘markup.su](http://markup.su/highlighter/) ... [☘hilite.me](http://hilite.me/) | Very handy for creating slides or team notebooks with pretty, formatted code snippets. Just copy the highlighted code snippets and paste them in your favorite WYSIWYG (What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get) editor! |
| ★★☆ | Code Sharing: ... [☘Ideone.com](http://ideone.com/) ... [☘Pastebin.com](http://pastebin.com/) ... [☘Ubuntu Pastebin](http://paste.ubuntu.com/) | These tools generate semi-permanent pages for code sharing. Very useful especially when you're trying to get someone else to look into your code. |
| ★★☆ | [Ineffable](http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/19083) | A simple command-line grader for local grading. |
